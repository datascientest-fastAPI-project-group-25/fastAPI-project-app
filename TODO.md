## Improvements

### Development Experience

- [ ] Add development environment setup script
- [ ] Improve error messages in Makefile targets
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running tasks
- [ ] Add validation for environment variables

### Code Quality

- [ ] Add more comprehensive linting rules

- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add code complexity checks

### Docker

- [ ] Optimize Docker builds
- [ ] Add multi-stage builds for all services
- [ ] Add Docker Compose profiles
- [ ] Add Docker health checks

### Maintenance

- [x] Add Docker cleanup targets (clean-docker)
- [x] Add Node.js cleanup targets (clean-node)
- [x] Add Python cleanup targets (clean-python)
- [x] Add dependency update targets (update, update-backend, update-frontend)
- [x] Add development tools update target (update-tools)

## Workflow Optimization Plan

1. **Streamline Python tools**
   - [x] Remove redundant tools (black, mypy)
   - [x] Focus on uv for dependency management
   - [x] Use ruff for linting and formatting

2. **Frontend improvements**
   - [x] Use Biome for formatting and linting
   - [x] Maintain pnpm for package management

3. **Security checks**
   - [x] Keep bandit and pip-audit
   - [x] Add safety checks for Python dependencies
   - [x] Run npm audit for frontend

4. **Testing strategy**
   - [x] Maintain pytest for backend tests
   - [x] Keep frontend test framework
   - [ ] Add coverage reporting

5. **Workflow optimization**
   - [x] Reduce duplicate setup steps
   - [x] Enable caching for uv and pnpm
   - [x] Set appropriate timeouts

## Branching Strategy Implementation Plan (2025-03-25)

1. **Main Branch Protection**
   - [ ] Add workflow to block direct pushes to main
   - [ ] Configure MachineUser for main branch testing
   - [ ] Set up required reviews for PRs to main

2. **Dev Branch Setup**
   - [ ] Create dev branch if not exists
   - [ ] Add workflow for staging deployments
   - [ ] Configure PR requirements for dev branch

3. **Branch Creation Process**
   - [ ] Enhance create-branch CLI tool
   - [ ] Add pre-branch creation checks (fetch main)
   - [ ] Implement branch type validation (feat/fix)

4. **Automated PR Workflow**
   - [ ] Add auto-PR creation for feat/fix branches
   - [ ] Configure required checks for PRs
   - [ ] Set up automatic staging builds on PR merge

5. **Main Branch Integration**
   - [ ] Add auto-PR creation from dev to main
   - [ ] Configure production builds on main merge
   - [ ] Implement version tagging and changelog generation

6. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Test MachineUser access with GH Action Secrets
   - [ ] Verify staging deployment workflow
   - [ ] Validate production build process

## Notes

- These features should be implemented incrementally
- Each feature should be properly tested before being added
- Documentation should be updated as features are added
- Consider adding feature flags for experimental features
- Makefile modularization should be done carefully to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Each module should be self-contained and have clear dependencies
- Consider using a module loader pattern for better organization
- Add version compatibility checks between modules
